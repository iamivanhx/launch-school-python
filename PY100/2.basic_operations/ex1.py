# Use concatenation to create your full name from your first and last names. The new string should contain your first name, a space, and your last name. For example, if your name is John Doe, you should combine 'John' and 'Doe' to get 'John Doe'.

print('John' + ' ' + "Doe")
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
print(first_name + ' ' + last_name)
